1. Introduction
Start with a one-liner about the project: "My project is a dictionary website that provides definitions, part-of-speech information, and usage tracking for English words, along with caching and database optimization to enhance performance."
2. Purpose
Explain why you built the project and its value: "The purpose of the project is to provide users with a fast and efficient platform to look up word definitions. It combines open API data, database storage, and caching to handle frequent searches efficiently while minimizing redundant external API calls."
3. Key Features
Highlight the main functionality, breaking it down into smaller points:

Search functionality: Users can search for words to get their definitions, parts of speech, and other details.
Usage tracking: The platform tracks how many times each word is searched and adjusts caching strategies based on its popularity.
Caching with Redis: Frequently searched words are cached for quicker responses and reduced server load.
Database Integration: If a word isn’t in the cache, it is fetched from the database (PostgreSQL) or an external API. New words are added to the database for future queries.
Dynamic Updates: The word count is updated and displayed in real-time on the frontend using server-side rendering and React.
4. Tech Stack
Mention the tools and frameworks you used, along with why you chose them:

Frontend: Next.js with TypeScript for a modern, scalable, and SEO-friendly interface.
Styling: Tailwind CSS for fast and responsive design.
Backend: Node.js API routes with Prisma as the ORM for PostgreSQL integration.
Caching: Redis for faster data retrieval and reduced API calls.
External API: Dictionary API to fetch word definitions not in the database.
5. Challenges and Solutions
Talk about a significant challenge you faced and how you overcame it:

Challenge: Handling duplicate Redis keys for words with varying casing (e.g., "fever" vs. "Fever").
Solution: Normalized all word inputs to lowercase before storing or retrieving from Redis, ensuring consistent caching behavior.
6. Your Role
Explain your contribution to the project: "I was responsible for the entire development process, including setting up the database schema, integrating Redis for caching, implementing API endpoints, and building the user interface. I also optimized performance by designing a caching strategy that dynamically adjusts based on word usage patterns."

7. Future Enhancements
Show that you’ve thought about the project’s scalability and potential improvements:

Adding Hindi and Bengali translations using NLP libraries.
Implementing fuzzy search for typo-tolerant queries.
Enhancing the user interface for a better experience.
Using analytics to provide insights into popular searches.
